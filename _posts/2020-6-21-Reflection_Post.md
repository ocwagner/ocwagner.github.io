This is the final course in my Master's program and I definitely feel like I'm going out with a bang - shot out of a cannon even! Without a doubt, I am learning a lot and I look forward to incorporating some of the tools we have learned in R into my work.

Things that I like about the course include assignment and project subject matter, which tend to be interesting in their own right. I also appreciate that the professor and TA are consistently available during office hours.

One aspect of the course that I dislike is that there seems to be strong "wild goose chase" component. I certainly appreciate the value in being able to find answers one one's own, through Stack Overflow or otherwise, but at least in my case I feel that I may actually retain more if I spent more time practicing simpler examples and less time trawling the internet for answers. The pace of the course is also intense but, it is my last one, so I'll grin and bear it =).

I think the lectures are clear and well organized. One thing that might be nice to add would be a discussion of questions that you recieved the previous week and/or mistakes/misunderstanding that were being observed in the course of assignments.
