title: Final reflection post

Because R can make quick work of complex statistical analysis, like random forests for example, the primary job of the data scientist as I see it is to:

1) Identify appropriate questions, based on subject matter expertise.

2) Identify appropriate models, which is a question of subject matter expertise and an adequate knowledge of statistics.

3) Structure the data in such a way that it can be processed by R / a computer, and;

4) Finally, share resulting insights with decision makers, a process that R makes much more effectvie with the availability of rich visualizations and user-friendly apps. 

Going into this course, I recognized that computer science was one leg of the three legged stool of data science but did not have a full appreciation for all that entailed. 
For me, the logic of computer programming is not the challenging part, rather it is the adherence to syntax and the ability to troubleshoot bugs in code. 

I will continue to use R going forward. As I said in earlier blog posts, I used to rely solely on excel but found my needs to be outpacing its abilities. Many people in my profession use R and I am pleased that I can no be part of that conversation. This course has provided excellent exposure to new (to me) non-linear modelling as well as unsupevised learning techniques, all of which I will incorporate into my future work.
