First blog post.

I'm ocwagner and I'm a Master's student in the Dept. of Agricultural Engineering. This is my last class in the program and if all goes well I'll be before I turn 40! Agriculture is becoming more data intensive and I want to be part of the conversation.

Data science lies at the confluence of statistics, computer science and domain expertise, which for me - would be agriculture. While this venn diagram approach helps define the field, it does not fully describe what a data scientist does. Data science spans the decision making process from a) helping to formulate questions to b) identifying patterns and developing models to support decision making. In between those steps, however, are the slightly less glamorous components of 1) knowing where to look for data, 2) developing a means of organizing and ingesting it and 3) applying statistical best practices to makes sure identified patterns and models are robust. I believe the major duties of data scientist are to discern actionable intelligence from datasets that are growing exponentially larger with news means of aquisition.

There is a great degree of overlap between statisticians and data scientists. Data science would not exist in a meaningful way without the robust underlying theory of statistics. Meanwhile statistics in its own right is probably becoming a less marketable skill without the added data science component. I am less interested in the theoretical component (though am thankful to the statisticians who are!) with my interests skewing more towards use of applied tools and domain expertise.
