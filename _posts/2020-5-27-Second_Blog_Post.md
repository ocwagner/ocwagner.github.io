I have spent more hours working on excel spreadsheets than I care to admit. While excel has a friendly, GUI interface, the logic to query databases and return certain values was not completely unlike R. Overtime, as I wanted to perform more sophisticated operations,work with larger datasets and create different visualizations I began to find excel quite limiting. Many excel operations need to be done on a one-off, or ad-hoc basis that do adjust well when the data changes shape, for example. Performing subsequent operations on that data can also require a lot of mouse clicks to get data in a workable format. In order to stay relevent as an economist and engineer, I have committed to developing some fluency in R. 

Last fall I took an intro to R course through the BAE department. That course focused very heavily on functions and less on data management amd collaboration and not at all on machine learning. The logic in R is not hard to follow and the syntax can be referenced fairly easily using the web or existing R practicioners. What I find most challenging about R are all the "unknown unknowns" - i.e. there are so many commands and functions available beyond what is covered in introductory texts that at times it can be difficult to discover they exist in the first place.
